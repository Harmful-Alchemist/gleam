            // imports: {imported_func: (arg) => console.log(arg)}, Aah with a different module can make a map of functions to names and put that in imports, the imports name is not special! Could put the gleam mjs there but(!) then tie it to js...
            imports: {"console.log": console.log } //So this works and we can get it... But is annoying we have to call outside.....
            // But how else are you going to do I/O, wasi https://wasi.dev/ ?
            // Browser polyfill: https://github.com/bjorn3/browser_wasi_shim ? Meh. Well maybe the meh is that you have to use it,
            // could still provide a nice way to do gleam/io maybe? But I'd say  @external with something we have now could be good too, easier anyway!

            // Or re-use the mjs: https://github.com/gleam-lang/stdlib/blob/main/src/gleam_stdlib.mjs#L294 ??? That'd be fun and allow one by one rewrite?
            // interesting: https://github.com/gleam-lang/stdlib/blob/main/src/gleam/io.gleam#L21

            // and these imports can be implemented in a variety of ways,
            // including by a JavaScript polyfill library running within browsers."
